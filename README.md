# Basic Github Best Practice
* The main branch has branch protection. The only way to push to the main branch is to submit a pull request (PR)
* One other person has to review the pull request before it is merged into the main branch
* At some point, we may implement some CI/CD to ensure that everything still works after merging
* For constructing new features, create a new branch.
* Each branch should ONLY focus on a single feature at once.
* If you want to work on something that requires multiple features, create a branch off of that branch
